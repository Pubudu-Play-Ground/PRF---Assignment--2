1.
Statically Typed Language - it is a language which checking the data types (int, long, floats, long etc) of declared variables at the compile time. 
Dynamically Typed Language - it is a language which checking the data types of declared variables at the run time(when executing).
Strongly Typed Language - strictly consider about the data types of variables at compiloe time and runtime.  
Loosely Typed Language - doesn't consider about the data type of variables.It allows for implicit type conversions and flexible data type usage. 
java is statically typed and strongly typed language.

2.
Case Sensitive - it is use to differentiate between uppercase and lowercase letters when using identifiers. 
Ex:-, "Java" and "java" would be treated as two different identifiers
case sensitive languages :- C, C++, Java, Swift, JavaScript, Python

Case Insensive - in this type of languages uppercase and lowercase letters are considered equivalent when using identifiers such as variable names. Ex:-, "Java" and "java" would be treated same identifiers
ex:SQL, HTML, CSS, and XML

3.
Identity Conversion - It is a type conversion operation that involves converting a value of a specific data type to the same data type without any change in the actual value. 
ex:
int num1 = 100;
long num2 = num1;

String str1 = "Hello";
String str2 = str;
